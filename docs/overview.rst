Overview
=========

Its a full fledged **social web app** which consists of **instant messaging** both public and private, **news feed**, **tweet-like** feature, with **comments**, **likes**, **shares**, notifications**, **livestream of activities** and a **web interface** to view and use the application.

**NOTE:** This is a smaple project still in progress.

This project was made with the intention of using **NodeJs** and **Koa** framework to experiment with.

This project also experiments with many web technologies and present day social features like **news feed**, **posts** (like **twitter's tweets), **notifications**, **livestream of activities** (like **facebook's tickr**), **material design**.

This project uses many computer science enginnering tools and tries to solve experiment with problems like what are the methods to show  live stream of activities, how to store and show news feed, the engineering problems that come across to solve these problems and many more. All in all, this project is a very good smaple project to learn many new technologies and solve good computer science problems. Its also good for **system design** and also who want to start off with **nodejs** and **koa**.

It uses **gulp** as the task runner with intentions to move to **webpack**. presently the web interface is primarily usign **bootstrap** and plain **html5** along with **css3** but plans to move to **react** with **redux**.
